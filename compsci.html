    <h4>AP Computer Science Teacher, former Microsoft Program Manager</h4>
    <p><strong>Q: What inspired you to puruse Computer Science?  </strong></p>
    <p  style="font-family:'Georgia';"> When I was in high school, the only CS-related class was an internet class that taught basic HTML and Photoshop skills.  I took the class and found myself spending hours designing web pages and graphics without even realizing it.  My dad is a computer scientist, so after that, he encouraged me to take Visual Basic and JavaScript classes at our local community college.  I discovered how much further I could take creations with code and how much I would get lost in doing it just for fun.  You know you have found your passion when you lose track of time doing something and don‚Äôt want to stop.  CS combined all the things that I loved: math, science, problem solving, and creativity.  That‚Äôs how I knew I wanted to pursue CS in college and beyond.  </p>


    <p><strong>Q: Did you ever experience Gender bias or lack of motivation to continue on this path?  </strong></p>
    <p  style="font-family:'Georgia';"> I have definitely encountered gender bias on my journey. As a woman in CS, I‚Äôve found that sometimes you have to work harder than men to prove yourself and earn the respect of your peers.  For the most part, people are pretty respectful, but there have been times early in my schooling and career when men would try to talk over me in group discussions or repeat an idea I just said as their own, as if I never said it.  In industry, there is a term called the ‚Äúbozo bit‚Äù, which is a switch that you turn on about someone when they prove to be incompetent and not worth listening to.  For men, the ‚Äúbozo bit‚Äù starts in the off position and has to be turned on.  For women, it sometimes feels like it‚Äôs on to start, and we have to work extra hard to turn it off.  Respect can certainly be earned over time, but you definitely have to work your way to the starting line that most men start at.  </p>

If anything, it made me want to work harder to break the barriers and prove that women can be just as competent if not more so than menüòâ. </p>

     <p><strong>Q: What advice do you have for women who are just starting off and what can we do to get more representation in Computer Science?  </strong></p>
    <p  style="font-family:'Georgia';"> My advice for women just starting off is to really lean into your passion in CS as something that makes you unique and strong. Convert your doubts and trepidation and discouragement from others into fuel to propel you to make that difference in the industry and the world.  Look to women who have succeeded in the field to encourage and inspire you on your journey! <b> To get more representation in CS, we need to make sure women don‚Äôt give into their doubts and quit before they begin.  And we can do that with great support, mentors, and reminders of how awesome they are, as well as how important women are to the future of technology.

    <h2 class="h2">Sarah Hawkinson</h2>
    <h4>Software Engeineer</h4>
    <p><strong>Q: What is your typical workday like? </strong></p>
    <p style="font-family:'Georgia';"> I am a Software Development Engineer at medium sized startup company. I‚Äôm a full stack developer, but I focus more on the front end. My typical day involves writing code to work on features or bug fixes, code reviewing other engineers, and attending status and design meetings.</p>
   <!--  Source: https://www.mashupmath.com/blog/famous-women-mathematicians -->
    <p><strong>Q: How did you decide that you wanted to go in Computer Science?</strong></p>
    <p style="font-family:'Georgia';">When I was little I wanted to be a doctor. I went to college for Chemical Engineering, but eventually switched my major to Computer Science. I realized that although it might not be in the same direct way as working with patients, I could change the world in the same way through technology.</p>


    <p><strong>Q: Do you think that there is a lack of women in the tech industry? If so, why do you think that is? </strong></p>
    <p style="font-family:'Georgia';"> I think there is definitely a lack of women in technology. I have seen teams that are pretty even gender¬≠wise, but overall there is definitely more men than women in the field as a whole. I think a lot of the gap comes from misinformation and education about what can be done in the technology field. A lot of times I see computer science being marketed towards kids with robots and video games which are typically things boys are more interested in, but the truth is you can do anything with technology. Every day we interact with technology in hundreds of different ways and all of those (and so many more) are opportunities to make a difference in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What advice would you give to a woman considering a career in the tech industry? What do you wish you had known?</strong></p>

    <p style="font-family:'Georgia';">  I would just say to go for it. I find more often than not people don‚Äôt think that they can get into the tech industry, but there are a lot of different roles and skills needed and so many different things you can do within the industry, so I would tell someone to just go for it and try. </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Rosalynn Chong</h2>
    <h4>Director of Engineering </h4>
    <p><strong>Q: When you graduated with a Computer Science degree, only 27% of all computer science majors were female.  What made you interested in the degree and what was your long-term goal in pursuing a career in computer science? </strong></p>
    <p  style="font-family:'Georgia';"> It was actually way back in high school when I took an ‚ÄúInformation Technology‚Äù class which introduced me to programming. It was a visual basic programming class and I got to create my own who wants to be a millionaire game in flash and I thought that was really cool.  I got really intrigued by it and I found the course really easy to understand and the assignments really fun to work on. From then on, I decided to continue on this path as it felt like I had some talent in it and that it was my calling.   All the other courses I took were fun too, but they weren‚Äôt as easy as computer science.  </p>

    <p><strong>Q: Do you feel that women in technology careers face barriers not faced by their male counterparts?  What are some challenges you‚Äôve faced? </strong></p>
    <p  style="font-family:'Georgia';">Personally, I don‚Äôt feel that way, as I am really lucky to have worked with people who respect women in the industry as much as anyone else. However, I do know that gender inequality does still exist in many companies and organizations and I hope that as more and more females enter the industry, women will be able to gain respect and eliminate any barriers that still exist now.  </p>

    <p><strong>Q: What‚Äôs the most exciting part of working for a software company?  </strong></p>
    <p  style="font-family:'Georgia';">The most exciting part for me, is that I get to learn and use new technology. The industry is always evolving and improving, and there are always faster, more efficient and better ways to do things. It really keeps me on my toes in order to keep up, because if I don‚Äôt, my knowledge becomes obsolete and useless in a few years! But it does make me really happy to look at the products we‚Äôve made in the past and present and appreciate the improvements we‚Äôve made from adopting these new technologies. </p>

   <p><strong>Q: What advice would you give your younger self or any woman pursuing a career in the tech industry?  
  </strong></p>
    <p  style="font-family:'Georgia';">My advice is don‚Äôt be scared, especially of how many men there are in the industry and go for it. If you have an interest in tech, keep learning and increasing your knowledge. Nobody and nothing can stop you from succeeding. There are so many free resources online now, you don‚Äôt even need to go to school to learn how to program, so it‚Äôs a great way for someone to dip their feet into tech and start learning.
